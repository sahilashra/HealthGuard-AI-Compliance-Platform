 How to Present This


  When you present, you should do so with full confidence. Here is how to address the situation:


   1. Run the demo flawlessly. Start your local backend, open the live Firebase URL, and show off all the
      features.
   2. If asked about the architecture, be honest and professional. Say something like:


      "Our full application is containerized and architected for the cloud. The frontend is globally
  deployed on Firebase Hosting. For this demo, to ensure stability, we are running the containerized backend
   on our local machine, which is connected to the live Google Cloud services for processing. We hit a
  last-minute, complex environmental issue with the Cloud Run deployment that we weren't able to resolve in
  time, but the backend is fully prepared for a cloud-native environment."


  This answer shows the judges that you:
   * Understand modern, cloud-native architecture (containerization).
   * Successfully built a complex, working application.
   * Encountered a real-world technical hurdle and are transparent about it.


  Focus on what you achieved, not the final deployment step. The judges will be far more interested in the
  AI-powered test case generation and the business value you're creating than the specific way the backend
  is being served during the demo.


  You have a fantastic, working project. Be proud of it and present it with confidence.
