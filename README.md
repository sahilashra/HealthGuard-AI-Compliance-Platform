## üöÄ 1. The Problem: The $31 Billion Compliance Bottleneck

In the healthcare industry, ensuring that software meets strict regulatory standards from the FDA, HIPAA, and ISO is a critical, high-stakes process. The current approach is almost entirely manual.

-   **Extremely Slow:** A single requirements document can take **40+ hours** of a skilled engineer's time to manually review and generate test cases for.
-   **Error-Prone:** Manual review is susceptible to human error, leading to missed compliance violations that can result in multi-million dollar fines and product recalls.
-   **Costly:** The combination of intense manual labor and severe penalties for failure costs the healthcare industry an estimated **$31 billion annually**.

This manual bottleneck delays the release of life-saving medical technology and stifles innovation.

## ‚ú® 2. Our Solution: From 40 Hours to 40 Seconds

**HealthGuard AI** is a revolutionary, AI-driven platform that transforms this process. We reduce the compliance review and test generation cycle from over 40 hours to under 40 seconds.

Our platform provides a seamless web interface where users can upload their software requirements documents and receive an instant, comprehensive compliance analysis.

### Key Features:

-   **ü§ñ Smart Compliance Scoring:** Instantly analyzes the document and provides a clear **Compliance Score (0-100%)** and a risk-level assessment (Low, Medium, High).
-   **üö® Real-time Violation Detection:** Automatically flags potential violations of key healthcare standards like **HIPAA** and **FDA 21 CFR**, providing AI-powered suggestions for how to fix them.
-   **üß™ AI-Powered Test Case Generation:** Generates a complete suite of high-quality, compliance-aware test cases directly from the requirements, ready for execution.
-   **üîó End-to-End Traceability:** Allows for one-click export of generated test cases to ALM tools like Jira and the download of a complete evidence bundle for auditors.

## üõ†Ô∏è 3. How It Works: Architecture & Technology

HealthGuard AI is built on a modern, scalable, and serverless architecture using the power of Google Cloud.

*(Note: This is a representative architecture diagram)*

### Data Flow:

1.  **Frontend:** The user uploads a requirements document through our **Next.js** web application, hosted on **Firebase Hosting**.
2.  **Backend API:** The file is sent to our backend, a **Node.js & Express** server running on a **Google Cloud Function**.
3.  **Secure Storage:** The document is securely stored in a **Google Cloud Storage** bucket.
4.  **AI Analysis Core:** The backend triggers our core analysis pipeline, which uses **Google's Gemini AI** to:
    a.  Parse and understand the requirements.
    b.  Compare the requirements against a knowledge base of compliance documents (FDA, HIPAA, ISO).
    c.  Generate the compliance score, violation list, and test cases.
5.  **Real-time Updates:** The results are streamed back to the user in real-time using **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** for a dynamic and responsive user experience.

### Technology Stack:

-   **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
-   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
-   **AI & Machine Learning:** Google Gemini
-   **Infrastructure:** Google Cloud Functions, Google Cloud Storage, Firebase Hosting

## üöÄ 4. Getting Started & Future Work

While the live demo is the best way to experience the project, the code is structured for future development.

### To Run Locally:

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  Run `npm install` in both the `frontend` and `functions` directories.
3.  Configure a Firebase project and connect it to the repository.
4.  Deploy the functions and hosting.

### Future Roadmap:

-   Expand the compliance knowledge base to include more regulations (e.g., GDPR, SOX).
-   Integrate with more ALM tools (e.g., Azure DevOps, TestRail).
-   Build a more advanced AI agent for interactive compliance Q&A.
